#### Advisory!
**This website is still under construction**

Hi! Welcome to my site and glad you are here. I'm currently a 5th year graduate student in the lab of Dr. Jeffrey Binder. My research is on semantics and how the brain represents concepts! 

For the archives of history, this domain also has my old website I made in undergrad [old.smazurchuk.com](http://old.smazurchuk.com)
