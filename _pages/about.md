Hi! Welcome to my site and glad you are here. I'm currently a 4th year medical student at the Medical College of Wisconsin. 

In 2024 I completed a PhD in the lab of Dr. Jeffrey Binder. My research focused on semantics and how the brain represents concepts! More specifically, my research was on explaining why, following damage to the brain, some people have deficits in knowledge for items in certain categories (such as living things). Analysis of this phenomemon, termed category specific semantic deficits (CSSDs), offers insight into the functional organization of the cortex. 

As a heads up, the blog on this site is not activetly maintained, and is primarily a copy of some [old posts](https://smazurchuk.github.io/) on my original Github pages site.
